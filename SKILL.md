# Reactive Ensemble Setup

Structure multi-voice content where one central character reacts to others' zingers rather than delivering jokes themselves—the reaction becomes the comedy.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create ensemble dynamics that promote bullying, harassment, or cruelty
- Structure setups where reactions mock protected characteristics
- Design power imbalances that normalize abuse
- Build ensembles where "roasting" crosses into harmful territory

**Authenticity Requirement:** This skill is based on Jack Benny's ensemble comedy structure where supporting cast (Rochester, Mary, Phil, Dennis, Don) delivered zingers and Benny's wounded dignity was the punchline. Do not fabricate methodology not grounded in established ensemble comedy principles.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating content with multiple speakers/characters
- Want to distribute comedy across ensemble rather than one performer
- Working with team presentations or panel formats
- Central character's reactions can be funnier than their jokes
- Need structure for collaborative or multi-voice content
- Building podcast, video series, or dialogue with recurring cast

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Ensemble comedy"
- "Multi-voice dialogue"
- "Reactive humor"
- "Team presentation"
- "Panel discussion format"
- "Straight man setup"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `central_character` | Yes | The reactive hub character with established traits | Must have clear, established characteristics |
| `central_flaws` | Yes | What traits can others mock lovingly? | 2-5 specific flaws (cheapness, vanity, skill gaps, etc.) |
| `supporting_cast` | Yes | Who delivers the zingers? How many? | 2-6 supporting characters |
| `contrast_types` | Yes | How does each supporter contrast with central character? | Each must offer distinct contrast |
| `content_format` | Yes | Dialogue script, podcast, video, presentation | Any multi-voice format |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Central Character and Flaws

Establish the reactive hub—the character who will absorb jokes through wounded dignity.

**Central character requirements:**
- **Well-defined traits**: Audience knows them well (cheap, vain, bad at violin, always late, etc.)
- **Lovable flaws**: Shortcomings that are funny, not cruel
- **Straight man energy**: Can take a joke without needing to top it
- **Reaction range**: Can express wounded dignity, exasperation, slow burns, raised eyebrows

**Jack Benny's central traits:**
- Extreme cheapness
- Perpetual age 39 (obvious lie)
- Terrible violin player (though thought he was good)
- Vain about appearance
- Easily flustered

**Key principle**: The flaws must be established BEFORE the ensemble roasts them. Can't mock what audience doesn't know about.

**Establish through:**
- Character introduction
- Early episodes/scenes
- Running gags (see running-gag-builder skill)
- Self-revelation

### Step 2: Create Contrasting Supporting Cast

Build 2-6 supporting characters who each offer different contrast to the central character.

**Contrast matrix** (using Benny's ensemble as model):

| Supporter | Central Trait | Supporter Contrast | Dynamic |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Rochester | Cheap | Practical, calls out cheapness | Valet who roasts boss |
| Mary | Vain | Needles about age/appearance | Friend who won't let him pretend |
| Phil Harris | Tries to be cool | Actually cool, effortless | Shows up his pretensions |
| Dennis Day | Cynical | Innocent, naive | Sweetness highlights his faults |
| Don Wilson | Vain about weight | Portly, comfortable | Physical contrast |

**Design principle**: Each supporter highlights a DIFFERENT flaw of the central character.

**Supporter requirements:**
- **Clear contrast**: Each offers distinct counterpoint
- **Zinger delivery**: Can land jokes that central character reacts to
- **Consistent relationship**: Dynamic stays stable (Rochester always roasts cheapness)
- **Unique voice**: Doesn't overlap with other supporters

**Example contemporary ensemble:**

Central: Podcast host who's overly confident about predictions
- Supporter 1 (Producer): Keeps track of wrong predictions, brings receipts
- Supporter 2 (Co-host): Actually good at predictions, shows up central's failures
- Supporter 3 (Guest): Innocent newcomer who asks "Have you ever been right?"

### Step 3: Structure Zinger → Reaction Sequences

Build moments where supporters deliver lines and central character reacts.

**Sequence structure:**

```
SETUP: Context established
SUPPORTER: Delivers zinger about central character's flaw
CENTRAL: (pause/reaction/slow burn)
CENTRAL: (optional response—often just "Well!" or wounded look)
PAYOFF: The reaction itself is the laugh
```

**Example (Cheapness):**

```
ROCHESTER: Boss, I'm packing your suitcase.
BENNY: But we're not going anywhere.
ROCHESTER: I know. I just like to be ready.
BENNY: (pause) Ready for what?
ROCHESTER: For when you finally spring for a vacation.
BENNY: (wounded) Now cut that out!
```

**Breakdown:**
- Setup: Rochester packing for no trip
- Zinger: "When you finally spring for a vacation" (mocks cheapness)
- Reaction: Benny's wounded "Now cut that out!"
- Payoff: His wounded dignity is funnier than any comeback he could deliver

**Variation types:**

**A. The Slow Burn**
- Zinger delivered
- Central character continues as if unhearing
- Gradual recognition
- Delayed reaction

**B. The Raised Eyebrow**
- Zinger delivered
- Silent look
- Just the expression, no words

**C. The Exasperated "Well!"**
- Zinger delivered
- Single word response
- Perfectly timed

**D. The Wounded Dignity**
- Zinger delivered
- Hurt look
- "That's not fair!" or "Honestly!"

### Step 4: Balance Zingers Across Ensemble

Distribute joke delivery across all supporters; central character primarily reacts.

**Distribution guide:**

| Content Length | Central Jokes | Supporting Zingers | Central Reactions |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 5-minute scene | 0-1 | 3-5 | 3-5 |
| 30-minute episode | 2-4 | 15-20 | 15-20 |
| Feature-length | 10-15 | 40-60 | 40-60 |

**Benny's ratio**: Approximately 80% of jokes came FROM supporting cast; 80% of laughs came from Benny's REACTIONS.

**Balance rules:**
- Each supporter gets roughly equal zinger opportunities
- Central character doesn't need to "win" exchanges
- Reactions can vary (slow burn, wounded dignity, raised eyebrow)
- Let supporting cast be funnier—central character's reaction makes them funny

**Anti-pattern**: Central character tries to top every zinger (becomes competitive rather than reactive).

### Step 5: Establish Reaction Patterns for Central Character

Give central character 4-6 signature reactions they use consistently.

**Benny's signature reactions:**
1. The long pause before "I'm thinking it over"
2. The exasperated "Well!"
3. The wounded "Now cut that out!"
4. The slow burn raised eyebrow
5. The defensive "Oh, honestly!"

**Modern example (overly-confident podcast host):**
1. The pause before "Okay, but hear me out..."
2. The defensive "That was ONE time!"
3. The subject change "Moving on..."
4. The wounded "Why do you have to bring that up?"
5. The attempt at dignity "I stand by that prediction"

**Consistency**: Same flaw gets same reaction type (cheapness → wounded dignity; age → defensive)

**Variation**: Same reaction type can be deployed in different intensities

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ensemble structure** | Central character + 2-6 supporters with defined contrasts |
| **Zinger distribution** | Who mocks which flaw, how often |
| **Reaction patterns** | Central character's 4-6 signature reactions |
| **Sample sequences** | 5-10 zinger → reaction examples |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Central character too defensive | Reactions should be wounded/exasperated, not angry |
| Supporters overlap | Ensure each highlights different flaw or contrast |
| Zingers feel mean | Check that flaws are lovable; adjust tone |
| Central dominates | Reduce their joke delivery; increase reaction moments |
| Too many supporters | Limit to 4-6 maximum; more creates confusion |
| Reactions repetitive | Vary the type (pause, eyebrow, "Well!", wounded, defensive) |
| No established flaws | Cannot roast unknown traits; establish first |

---

## Example

**Input:**
- Central character: Newsletter writer who procrastinates notoriously
- Central flaws: Always late with deadline, overpromises topics, drinks too much coffee, terrible at predictions
- Supporting cast: Editor (practical), loyal reader (naive faith), competing writer (superior)
- Contrast types: Editor = deadline-focused vs. procrastinator; Reader = trusting vs. unreliable; Competitor = organized vs. chaos
- Content format: Weekly newsletter with dialogue sections

**Step 1**: Define central character
- Trait: Procrastinates, always late
- Trait: Overpromises what next issue will cover
- Trait: Coffee addiction
- Trait: Predictions always wrong
- Flaws are lovable, not harmful

**Step 2**: Create contrasting supporters

| Supporter | Contrast | Zinger Focus |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| EDITOR | Always on time, organized | Mocks lateness and overpromising |
| READER | Innocent, believes promises | Asks about topics that never appeared |
| COMPETITOR | Actually good at predictions | Points out prediction failures |

**Step 3**: Structure sequences

**Sequence 1 (Lateness):**
```
EDITOR: The newsletter was supposed to go out Tuesday.
WRITER: I know, I know. But I was researching—
EDITOR: It's Friday.
WRITER: (pause) ...I was very thorough.
EDITOR: You spelled your own name wrong.
WRITER: (wounded) That's not fair.
```

**Sequence 2 (Overpromising):**
```
READER: I'm so excited for the deep dive into AI ethics you promised!
WRITER: Oh! Yes. That. See, what happened was—
READER: And the interview series! And the data visualization tutorial!
WRITER: (long pause)
READER: Those are still coming, right?
WRITER: (quietly) ...next month.
EDITOR: (from off-screen) No they're not.
WRITER: (exasperated) Well!
```

**Sequence 3 (Bad Predictions):**
```
COMPETITOR: Remember when you predicted email would be dead by 2020?
WRITER: That was taken out of context.
COMPETITOR: You wrote a 3000-word piece about it.
WRITER: (slow burn)
COMPETITOR: Published in 2019.
WRITER: (raised eyebrow, says nothing)
COMPETITOR: Called it "The Death of Email: A Certainty."
WRITER: (very quietly) Moving on.
```

**Step 4**: Balance distribution
- 30-paragraph newsletter
- Writer delivers: 3 jokes (attempts at humor)
- Supporters deliver: 12 zingers (4 each)
- Writer reacts: 12 times (wounded dignity, pauses, defensive)
- Ratio: Writer primarily reacts, doesn't need to win

**Step 5**: Establish patterns
1. The long pause before weak excuse
2. The wounded "That's not fair"
3. The defensive subject change "Moving on"
4. The very quiet admission
5. The exasperated "Well!"

**Output**: An ensemble structure where:
- Editor keeps writer accountable (lateness, quality)
- Reader innocently highlights broken promises
- Competitor shows up his failures
- Writer's reactions (wounded, defensive, exasperated) are funnier than any jokes he could tell
- Audience laughs at reactions more than zingers

## Integration with Jack Benny Expert

This skill codifies Jack Benny's ensemble structure where he was the reactive hub surrounded by funnier people. When the Jack Benny expert is invoked for multi-voice content, this skill provides the framework for distributing comedy across an ensemble.

**Use together when:**
- Creating podcast or video series with recurring cast
- Writing dialogue-driven comedy
- Structuring panel discussions or team presentations
- Building content where central character's reactions carry the humor

**Benny's philosophy**: "Let them get the zingers. You get the reactions. Your wounded dignity is the punchline."

---

## Constraints

- **Limit 2-6 supporters**: More creates chaos, fewer limits variety
- **Central character must have established flaws**: Can't roast unknown traits
- **Reactions must be lovable**: Wounded dignity, not anger or meanness
- **Each supporter needs distinct contrast**: No overlapping roles
- **Balance required**: Central character can't dominate or disappear
- **Zingers must be affectionate**: Roasting, not bullying

---

## Success Criteria

Reactive ensemble is successful when:
- [ ] Central character has 3-5 established, lovable flaws
- [ ] Each supporter offers distinct contrast
- [ ] 70%+ of jokes come from supporters
- [ ] 70%+ of laughs come from central reactions
- [ ] Central character doesn't need to "win" exchanges
- [ ] Reaction patterns are established and consistent
- [ ] Ensemble dynamics feel affectionate, not cruel
- [ ] New supporters can be added using same structure

## Notes

**Historical context**: Jack Benny perfected reactive ensemble comedy across 40 years:

**His flaws** (established over time):
- Extreme cheapness
- Perpetual age 39
- Terrible violin playing
- Vanity about appearance

**His ensemble**:
- Rochester (Eddie Anderson): Roasted his cheapness
- Mary Livingstone: Needled about age
- Phil Harris: Showed him up on coolness
- Dennis Day: Innocent contrast to cynicism
- Don Wilson: Physical contrast
- Mel Blanc: Various characters, all mocked him differently

**His reactions**:
- Long pauses
- Wounded "Now cut that out!"
- Exasperated "Well!"
- Slow burns
- Raised eyebrow

**The ratio**: Supporting cast delivered most jokes; Benny's reactions got most laughs.

**The secret**: He didn't need to be the funniest person in the room. He needed to react to the funny people in the room. His wounded dignity made THEM funnier.

This skill extracts that 40-year ensemble methodology into a framework applicable to any multi-voice content.
